1. Do we store USER_AREA_PAGE block in DISK_MAP_TABLE

2. Inuput of GET_CODE_PAGE

3. Input of RELEASE_BLOCK (whether PID passed or not)

4. In RELEASE_BLOCK do we decrement the entry of DISK_FREE_LIST or nake it 0.(also  if DISK_FREE_LIST contains entries 0 & 1 or the number of processes sharing that block)

5. Do we directly use "print" in exception handler or use TERMINAL_WRITE of DEVICE_MANAGER module. (IMP!!! if using TERMONAL_WRITE.. remember to save values of Exception REGS. in stack and pop them back after terminal write ....ie, along with saving R0, R1, R2, R3..etc do for EC, EIP, EPN etc.)

6. IMP!!!!! In exception handler when we call GET_CODE_PAGE shouldnt we also push EPN EMA etc.  since GET_CODE PAGE might schedule another process which MIGHT generate another exception so values of Exception REGISTERS might change...
